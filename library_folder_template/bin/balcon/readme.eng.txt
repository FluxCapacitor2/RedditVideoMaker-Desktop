*** Configuration File ***

The command line options can be stored as a configuration file "balcon.cfg" in the same folder as the utility.

The sample configuration file:
===============
-f d:\Text\book.txt
-w d:\Sound\book.wav
-n Microsoft Anna
-s 2
-p -1
-v 95
-e 300
-d d:\Dict\rules.bxd
-lrc
--lrc-length 75
--lrc-enc utf8
--lrc-offset 300
===============

The utility may combine options from the configuration file and the command line.


*** Audio Clips ***

The application allows to insert links to external WAV files (audio clips) into text. Audio clip tag will look like:

{{Audio=C:\Sounds\ring.wav}}

When speaking text aloud, the utility will pause when the audio clip tag is reached, play the audio clip and resume speaking.
When converting to audio files, the audio clip will be embedded in the audio file created by the application.
